# Hi, I'm Oluwatobi Mustapha

**Cloud SOC Analyst (AWS-Focused) | Incident Response | Threat Detection**

I simulate real-world threats in the cloud, build detection pipelines with AWS-native tools, and automate incident response workflows. I focus on solving real problems, improving response speed, and documenting everything I learn.

## About Me

I'm an Electrical engineering graduate building a focused career in cloud security.

My current work revolves around **AWS-based threat detection and SOC automation**. I study the way attackers move in the cloud, simulate those behaviors in my lab, and build real-time detection and response systems using services like **GuardDuty**, **CloudTrail**, **EventBridge**, and **Lambda**.

I share my journey publicly, with one goal: **to get better through consistent, hands-on practice**.
